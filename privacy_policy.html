        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Dykketreff (hereby “Dykketreff” or “the app”) is the name of the Commercial app for use with iOS that this privacy policy is about.</p>

        <p>Basically we do not collect any data at all. Zero, none, zilch. Heck we do not even have a server to store anything on. But to appease the regulations and follow Apple’s privacy procedures we provide a document conforming to the standard privacy policy lingo.</p>

        <p>This document is used to inform users regarding Dykketreffs’s policies with the collection, use, storage and disclosure of Personal and Organizational Information associated with the use of the app. By choosing to use our app you agree to the use of information as detailed in this policy.</p>

        <p>Dykketreff uses only the information necessary to provide the implemented feature-sets of the product. We will not collect and use your information, and do not share this data with any third party with the exception of vendors of necessary subsystems.</p>

        <p>Information provided to Dykketreff through other means than directly or indirectly through the app, such as contact with Sales and Support teams or use of other services and products than those outlined in this document, is not covered by this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>To provide the functionality offered by the app, we may require you to provide the app with certain information that may convey fully or partially personally identifiable information. This collection is limited to:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Geographical position(s)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The above listed information will only be retained by Dykketreff to the extent necessary to:<br>

        <ul>
            <li>Implement the functionality provided in the app</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Note that no data is collected or stored anywhere, the GPS location is purely for the benefit of the user experience and is presented as an opt in feature. If you do not want Dykketreff to have your user location, that is fine and will only to a limited extent impair the user experience.</p>

        <h2>Service Providers</h2>

        <p>We may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
                    <li>To provide the Service on our behalf; or</li>
                    <li>To perform Service-related services;</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

        <p>Third parties providing product subsystems, such as providing geographic maps, are only subject to the constraints outlined in the previous section to the extent permitted within their respective Privacy Policies (linked to below). The responsibility to track changes in these third party Privacy Policies affecting the users of this app, falls on the user and not on the makers of Dykketeff.</p>

        <p>To enable sharing with Facebook Messenger, the Facebook SDK framework is added to the application. When using the Facebook SDK, certain events in your app are automatically logged and collected for Facebook Analytics unless automatic event logging is disabled. In this application automatic event logging has been disabled, and no information is logged and collected for Facebook Analytics.</p>
